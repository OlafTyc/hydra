## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Summary
Reads have been merged with `r snakemake@params[["mergemethod"]]`

## Plot
```{r cars}
library(plotly)
readstat = read.csv('readstat.csv')
plot_ly(readstat, y=~avg_len, type='scatter', text=~filename)
```
