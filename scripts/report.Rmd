## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Summary
Reads have been merged with `r snakemake@params[["mergemethod"]]`

## Plot
```{r cars, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(plotly)
readstat = read.csv('readstat.csv')
p <- ggplot(readstat, aes(y=readstat$avg_len, x = seq(1, length(readstat$avg_len)))) + geom_point()

ggplotly(p)
```
